# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`NTComponents/` is the main Blazor component library. Features are grouped by folder (for example `Buttons/`, `Form/`, `Grid/`, `Dialog/`), and most components are split into `.razor`, `.razor.cs`, `.razor.scss`, and optional `.razor.js` files with the same base name.  
`NTComponents.Tests/` contains .NET tests (xUnit/bUnit/Playwright) plus JS interop tests in `NTComponents.Tests/wwwroot/*.test.js`.  
`NTComponents.AspNetCore/` and `NTComponents.Extensions/` provide supporting packages.  
`NTComponents.Site/` and `LiveTest/` are sample/demo hosts.  
`Submodules/NTComponents.Charts/` is a Git submodule and should be updated intentionally.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `dotnet restore` - restore NuGet packages for all projects.
- `dotnet build NTComponents.slnx -c Release` - build all projects with analyzers and Sass compilation.
- `dotnet test NTComponents.Tests/NTComponents.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-build` - run C# unit/component/E2E tests.
- `npm ci` - install JS test dependencies.
- `npm test` - run Jest suites in `NTComponents/**/__tests__` and `NTComponents.Tests/wwwroot`.
- `pwsh ./test-aot-compatibility.ps1` - validate AOT publish compatibility.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow `.editorconfig`:
- 4-space indentation, CRLF line endings.
- Braces required; file-scoped namespaces preferred.
- Prefer `var` when type is obvious.
- Private fields/properties use `_camelCase`.
- Public types/methods/properties use `PascalCase`; interfaces start with `I`.

Keep related component files co-located and consistently named (example: `TnTButton.razor`, `TnTButton.razor.cs`, `TnTButton.razor.scss`).

## Testing Guidelines
Use xUnit v3 + bUnit for C# tests and Playwright for browser E2E coverage. Use Jest for JS modules.
- C# test files: `*.Tests.cs`
- JS test files: `*.test.js`

Before opening a PR, run both `dotnet test` and `npm test`. CI runs both and installs Playwright browsers.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use Conventional Commits with scope where helpful:
- `feat(dialog): ...`
- `fix(input): ...`
- `refactor(grid): ...`

`chore(release): x.y.z` commits are generated by semantic-release; avoid creating these manually.

PRs should include a concise summary, linked issue(s), and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes. Keep PRs focused and call out breaking changes explicitly.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not commit secrets. Use repository/GitHub Actions secrets for publish credentials and environment-specific configuration.
